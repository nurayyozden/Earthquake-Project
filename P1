For this project that transforms and cleans the data, I showcase my abilities through Excel.

Driving questions:
Are all the data types for each feature consistent?
Are there any missing/unreadable values?
Are there any columns that need to be separated? Combined?
Are there any transformations that need to be done for future comprehension?

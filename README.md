# Earthquake-Project
A 3-part project on Turkey's earthquakes from 1915 - May 2023.

Project 1 (P1): Video explanation of data cleaning, transformation and interpretation.

Project 2 (P2): Notebook of preliminary data analysis and modeling.

Project 3 (P3): Notebook of Machine Learning models.

I chose this dataset to clean and transform because of a personal connection to the topic - my father immigrated to the US from Turkey 30 years ago, and I am very connected to my Turkish heritage. The earthquake in Turkey in 2023 impacted many friends and family, including my grandparents. Understanding Turkeyâ€™s history of earthquakes on a quantitative level and creating connections with the data given opens the door to a deeper, more holistic understanding of a tragic occurrence.
